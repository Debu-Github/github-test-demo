# github-test-demo
demo repository to show work flow

Overview
This guide provides information on how to work with Github at Turbot.

Issues
Issues should be created to be as specific as possible, allowing for a clear history of changes and the reason for doing them. Another benefit to small, specific changes, is to make code review or backing out a change as easy as possible.

Policies
Issues for policies should have a title that matches the format Action Provider > Service > Resource > Policy Type Policies. For example, Add AWS > IAM > User > Approved Policies.

Labels
All labels should start with # and the label name should be Camel case (lower).
