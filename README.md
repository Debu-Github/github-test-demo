# Overview

This guide provides information on how to work with Github at Turbot.

## Issues

Issues should be created to be as specific as possible, allowing for a clear history of changes and the reason for doing them. Another benefit to small, specific changes, is to make code review or backing out a change as easy as possible.

### Policies

Issues for policies should have a title that matches the format *Action Provider > Service > Resource > Policy Type Policies.* For example, *Add AWS > IAM > User > Approved Policies.*

## Labels

All labels should start with # and the label name should be Camel case (lower).
